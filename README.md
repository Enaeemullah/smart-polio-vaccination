Polio virus is considered to be one of the major problems of Pakistan in the health zone. As Pakistan is ranked among those three endemic nations, who are still struggling in the eradication of polio. The cause of this problem is that the polio vaccination is not effectively distributed among children who acquire polio vaccination. The reason behind this problem that health department and their polio eradication team are facing many problems. The main aim of our project of Smart Polio vaccination delivery system is to help the health department in checking and verifying that whether the polio eradication team is distributing the polio vaccination to all eligible children. The objective of this project is that every child of Pakistan should be safe from this polio virus and to reduce the number of cases of the children who are affected by the polio virus in Pakistan.
